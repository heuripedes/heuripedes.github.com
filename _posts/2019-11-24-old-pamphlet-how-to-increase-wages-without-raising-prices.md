# How To Increase Wages Without Raising Prices

**THE BIBLE SOLUTION TO THE LABOR-MANAGEMENT DISPUTE**  
by ALEXANDER SCHIFFNER

When men are under subjection to another’s will and command without adequate compensation for services rendered it is slavery no matter by what name such service may be called, for slavery is the involuntary servitude of one human being to another.

No question has aroused so much interest as the present labor-management dispute. The failure to offer a solution satisfactory to both industry and labor has led to strife and bloodshed. But it is impossible to make an equitable adjustment of wages which will be satisfactory to both employer and employee until certain fundamental changes are made in our economy.

Both employers and employees are under pressure today – the former endeavoring to remain in business; the latter to meet ever increasing living costs.

The money needed by the employer to meet his payrolls and to purchase his stock is furnished by the money lenders to whom he must pay tribute. Too, he must pay dividends, earned by the employees, to the stockholders who through no labor on their part receive the fruits of another's labor.

Our national payroll is approximately 150 billion dollars annually. Another 75 billion dollars (approximate) is paid to non-producers in the form of dividends on their investments or to financiers in discounts or interest. Labor therefore produces 225 billion dollars worth of goods annually but receives only a part of what it produces.

Why should a third party who contributes nothing, either in brains or brawn, receive the fruits of another’s labor? In collecting tribute for the financing of production, the producer is robbed of his profits and the laborer of his wages.

When industry shakes itself loose from the present enslaving usury system, labor and management alike will receive the full fruitage of their labor. Money was never meant to be a producer. It is not a producer. Yet we permit it to produce for thousands at the expense of the workers. The Bible says “that if any would not work, neither should he eat.” 2 Thes. 3:10 Labor needs the employer who in turn needs labor and its services, yet neither actually needs the financial non-producers.

Vested financial interests have been able to remain aloof from most labor disputes, making both management and labor assume that their difficulties are the result of the greed of the laborer or the selfishness of the employer, when in fact both are dupes and slaves of a financial system which reaps both ends and the middle.

STOP PAYING TO THIS THIRD PARTY THAT FOR WHICH IT HAS NEVER WORKED OR LABORED AND WAGES CAN BE INCREASED WITHOUT RAISING PRICES.

This parasite third party should be as much concerned about bringing about a change in our economy as in labor and management. Especially since we are witnessing the fulfillment of James 5:1-5. Read it.
